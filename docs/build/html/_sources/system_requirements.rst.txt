System Requirements
===================

To install and run Vortex Linux, ensure your system meets the following minimum requirements:

- **Processor**: 64-bit CPU
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM
- **Storage**: 20 GB of available disk space
- **Network**: Internet connection for downloading updates and packages

.. note::

   If your device meets only the minimum requirements, consider using less demanding configurations for your desktop environment. For instance, opt for XFCE instead of something heavy like GNOME to enhance performance. Additionally, limit the use of Ship VMs to specific needs, such as gaming, to avoid overloading your system.

Recommended Requirements
------------------------

For optimal performance, it is recommended to have:

- **Processor**: Multi-core 64-bit CPU
- **Memory**: 8 GB RAM or more
- **Storage**: 50 GB of available disk space
- **Graphics**: Dedicated GPU for enhanced graphical performance

.. note::

   The recommended requirements should allow you to use Vortex Linux efficiently. Although Vortex Linux is a highly flexible distribution, if your system just barely meets these requirements, be mindful of system resource usage, especially when running resource-intensive tasks or using Ship VMs.
