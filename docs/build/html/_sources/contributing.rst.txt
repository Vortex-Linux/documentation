How to Contribute
=================

We welcome contributions from the community! There are numerous tasks across various fields, and we would love to have skilled individuals in different areas.

**Note**: Our organization is divided into four major teams. When making changes, you might be assigned to different teams for various tasks.

2. **System Development Team**: [Vortex-Linux/system-development-team](https://github.com/Vortex-Linux/system-development-team)

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

1. **Join Our Discord**: Please join our Discord server and ping a moderator to get the developer role. This will help you get started and connect you with other developers.
   
2. **Find Your Repository or Subproject**: Identify which repository or subproject you will be working on. Collaborate with others to understand what tasks need to be done before you start working.

3. **Assigned Branch**: Work in your assigned branch where tasks in your specific area are being handled. Collaborate with others working on similar tasks on the same branch. If necessary, you can fork the repository to work independently.

4. **Creating Branches**: If you are given a specific task that requires new branches, you are allowed to create them as long as they are necessary. After completing your task, send a pull request to your development branch.

5. **Pull Requests**: You might be assigned to work on a sub-branch. In this case, send a pull request to the parent branch, which will then be merged into the development branch. This process helps reduce merge conflicts and distributes work efficiently.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter any issues, please report them on the appropriate GitHub repository within our organization or on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MsF24qUA5y).

1. **Search for existing issues**: Ensure your issue hasn't already been reported.
2. **Create a new issue**: Provide a detailed description of the problem and steps to reproduce it.
3. **Label your issue**: Use appropriate labels to categorize your issue.

**Note**: When reporting an issue on GitHub, please ensure you are reporting it in the correct repository to reach the appropriate team. We prefer you to use Discord to report issues, as we use Discord to keep track of issues. Regardless of the platform, make sure to use the right labels so that the correct developers can address it.
